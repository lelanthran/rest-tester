Variable Substitution
---------------------

Switch `rest_test_t` objects from using strings for each field storage
using `rest_test_token_t *` objects: we need to know whether an object is a
string or a symbol (in order to perform variable substitution). This has a
large impact:
1. Prior to `curl` being called, each symbol must be replaced with a value
   from the symbol table.
2. Prior to `curl` being called, each string must be checked for variable
   interpolation. Due to how the parser works, we cannot support string
   concatenation.

Assertions
----------

Have a large problem with assertions: how can we tell when they end? We lose
the newlines during the tokenisation.

It might be best for assertions to always end with a semi-colon, and have the
tokeniser return the semi-colon seperately from the string.
